## How teams are organized around big data activities in the corporate world

### Three groups

1. Metadata group
   - Abstract thinkers
   - Deal with categorizing and normalizing data and datasets
   - Partnerships around real world problems

2. Interface group
   - Engineering people, focused on standards
   - Gaining access to the information
   - Data is ready to be couples with othe datasets to be used in potentially answering a question

3. Question-former group
   - PhD and/or marketing people
   - Asking the meaningful questions
   - *Not* data-driven ... just trying to imagine the most important questions

Each team could be tens or hundreds of people.

Data analysts work across groups to answer questions
